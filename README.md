# PBS Admin
PBS Admin exists to make it simple to manage permissions in your PBS. PBS Admin is a modular and robust admin system designed from the ground up to integrate into a personal server. PBS Admin features a GUI reminiscent of Kohls Beta, while offering a refined modern user experience including smart autocomplete and command linting as you type. PBS Admin also serves as a comprehensive way to manage default tools based on a user's role.

The modular system makes it simple to add custom commands. The permissions system can also be used to integrate validation into other systems. 
PBS Admin is packaged with basic administrative commands to manage your personal server, as well as some of the fun commands you would expect from Kohls. The modular system makes it very easy to remove commands you do not want, and edit the rank required to use each command. 

PBS Admin is included in PBS: Rewritten, but standalone versions and documentation can be found here.

> [!NOTE]
> A complete overhaul to the documentation is currently in progress
